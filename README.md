## Installation

### Pre-installation steps
1. Navigate to https://my.home-assistant.io/ and make sure the Home Assistant Instance
   is configured correctly to point to your local Home Assistant instance.
2. Power on all your SmartSlydr devices.
3. Turn **OFF** the wifi on your phone and make sure all the appliances are operational in the LycheeThings mobile app.

### Installation
1. The esiest way to install the integration is using HACS. Just click the
   button bellow and follow the instructions:
   [![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=ekutner&repository=home-connect-hass)
   Alternatively, go to Settings -> Devices & Services in Home Assistance and click the "Add Integration" button. Search for "SmartSlydr" and install it.
2. Next you will be asked to provide the LycheeThings app credentials you
   created erlier.
3. Congratulations, you're done!
   SmartSlydr Cloud will now start downloading the data for your
   SmartSlydr devices and will add the entities for them to Home Assistant.
   Note that the integration dynamically discoveres entities as they are made available by the API, so expect new entities to be added in the first few uses of the appliances.
